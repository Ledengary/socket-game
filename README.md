# The Alphabet Game
 The sixth project of the "Advanced Programming" course \
 In this project, I have developed The Alphabet Game using socket programming in Java. In this game by setting a specific time, two to five players connect to a specific server room in which they can play. Each player fills the predefined columns (Surname, Lastname, Animal, City, and...) and by clicking stop all players in a room are stopped and graded based on their answers.
